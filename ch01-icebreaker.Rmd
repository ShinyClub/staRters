# Ice breaker

 1. Go to a random break out room Teams session
 2. Study the code below for 3 minutes (by yourself)
 3. Run the complete code
 4. Discuss in the room what you think that every line is supposed to do: take max. 7 minutes for this. Try linking what you see in the graph to what you see in the code. 
 5. Return to the plenary room Teams session
 
To run the code -whole code chunk- click the little green arrow in top right corner of the code-chunk below, or -line by line- set the cursor to the first line of the code and press `Cntrl` + `Enter`. Try adding comments (#<comment>) before a line if you think you understand what it does

```{r, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=4}
# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)

# <write here what you tqhink the following line does, run the code first>
data(package = "dslabs")

# click on the "Environment" panel [top-right RStudio Window] and 
# click on "gapminder" ------------------------------------------------------->
data("gapminder", package = "dslabs") 
names(gapminder)

# <comment on the code that follows, can you add a comment on each line?>
