# Why use R? {#whyr}

## Packages
```{r, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(nlme)
```

## Data, methods and logic {.build}

*[Brown, Kaiser & Allison, PNAS, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1708279115)*

"...in science, three things matter:

 >1. the data, 
 >1. the methods used to collect the data [...], and 
 >1. **the logic connecting the data and methods to conclusions,**

everything else is a distraction."

## When things go wrong {.build}

```{r, dpi = 80, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(
  here::here(
    "images",
    "gollum_climbing.jpg"
  )
)
```

 "In one case, a group accidentally used reverse-coded variables, making their conclusions the opposite of what the data supported."

 "In another case, authors received an incomplete dataset because entire categories of data were missed; when corrected, the qualitative conclusions did not change, but the quantitative conclusions changed by a factor of >7"

## Why we need Reproducible (Open) Science?

 >- To assess validity of science and methods we need access to data, methods and conclusions
 >- To learn from choices other researchers made
 >- To learn from omissions, mistakes or errors
 >- To prevent publication bias (also negative results will be available in reproducible research)
 >- To be able to re-use and/or synthesize data (from many and diverse sources)
 >- To have access to it all!

## The _GUI problem_

How would you 'describe' the steps of an analysis or creation of a graph when you use *GUI* based software? 

*_"You can only do this using code, so it is (basically) impossible in a GUI"_*

```{r, dpi = 80}
knitr::include_graphics(
  here::here(
    "images",
    "messy_steps.jpg"
  )
)
```

<p style="font-size:14px">*[Graphical User Interface (GUI)...is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface)</p>

## Programming is essential for Reproducible (Open) Science {.build}

 >- Only programming an analysis (or creation of a graph) records every step
 >- The script(s) function as a (data) analysis journal 
 >- Code is the logic that connects the data and methods to conclusions 
 >- Learning to use a programming language takes time but pays of at the long run (for all of science)

## Introducing Literate programming

 - Literate) programming is a way to connect narratives to data, methods and results
 - All scripts in this course are **R Markdown** scripts
 - The complete source of the reader is available in Github.com

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images","rmd_printscr.png"))
```

## To  replicate a scientific study we need at least:

 > - Scientific context, research questions and state of the art [<mark>P<mark/>]
 > - (Experimental) model or characteristics of population or matter studied [<mark>P</mark>]
 > - Data that was generated and corresponding meta data [<mark>D</mark>, _C_]
 > - **Exact** (experimental) design of the study [<mark>P</mark>, _D_, <mark>C</mark>]
 > - Exploratory data analysis of the data [_P_, <mark>C</mark>]
 > - **Exact** methods that were used to conduct any formal inference [_P_, <mark>C</mark>]
 > - Model diagnostics [_C_]
 > - Interpretations of the (statistical) model results/model fitting process [_P_, _C_]
 > - Conclusions and academic scoping of the results [<mark>P</mark>, _C_]
 > - **Access to all of the above** [<mark>OAcc, OSrc</mark>]

<p style="font-size:14px">$P = Publication$, $D = Data$, $C = Code$, $OAcc = Open\ Access$, $OSrc = Open\ Source$ </p>

## A short example of Reproducible (Open) Science

Assume we have the following question:
"Which of 4 types of chairs takes the least effort to arise from when seated in?"
We have the following setup:

 - 4 different types of chairs
 - 9 different subjects (probably somewhat aged)
 - Each subject is required to provide a score (from 6 to 20, 6 being very lightly strenuous, 20 being extremely strenuous) when arising from each of the 4 chairs. There is some 'wash-out' time in between the trials. The chair order is randomised.

To analyze this experiment statistically, the model would need to include: the rating score as the **measured (or dependent) variable**, the type of chair as the **experimental factor** and the subject as the **blocking factor**

## Now we move to RStudio

 - If you have 2 screens, now is the moment to expand the screen
 - Login to your Rstudio Environment
 - Open the file `_why_r.Rmd`
 - Follow along the demo by running the code
 - Details on using RStudio can be found in `_introrstudio`

## Mixed effects models

A typical analysis method for this type of randomized block design is a so-called 'multi-level' or also called 'mixed-effects' or 'hierarchical' models. An analysis method much used in clinical or biological scientific practice. 
 
You could also use one-way ANOVA but I will illustrate why this is not a good idea 

## What do we minimally need, to replicate the science of this experiment? {.build}

I will show:

 >- the data 
 >- an exploratory graph 
 >- a statistical model 
 >- the statistical model results
 >- a model diagnostic
 >- some conclusions 
 
In the next few slides, I will hopefully convince you of the power of (literate) programming to communicate such an analysis. 

<p style="font-size:14px">[Example reproduced from: Pinheiro and Bates, 2000, _Mixed-Effects Models in S and S-PLUS_, Springer, New York.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nlme/index.html)</p>
 
## The data of the experiment

<p style="font-size:14px">[Wretenberg, Arborelius & Lindberg, 1993](https://doi.org/10.1080/00140139308967910)</p>


```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(nlme)
ergoStool %>% as_tibble()
```

## An exploratory graph
I like the initial plot that I create of a new dataset to contain **ALL** the data. Here, I combine the scatter plot with a boxplot to get a feel for the spread and the group means. Mind the ordering on the x-axis, which is set according the mean value of the `effort` variable. 
```{r}
colours <- c("red","blue", "green", "darkblue", "darkgreen", "purple", "grey", "black", "darkgrey")
set.seed(123)
plot_ergo <- ergoStool %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Type, effort), y = effort)) + 
  geom_boxplot(colour = "darkgreen", outlier.shape = NA) + 
  geom_jitter(aes(colour = reorder(Subject, -effort)), 
              width = 0.2, size = 3) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = colours) +
  ylab("Effort (Borg scale score)") +
  xlab("Chair type") + 
  guides(colour=guide_legend(title="Subject id")) +
  theme_bw()
plot_ergo
```

## Mind the variability per subject, what do you see?

 - Can you say something about within-subject variability (note 'Minster Blue')?
 - Can you say something about between-subject variability (note 'Mister Green', vs 'Mister Black')?
 - Which chair type takes, on average the biggest effort to arise from?
 
```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=3}
plot_ergo
```

## The statistical questions

 1. Which chair type takes, on average the biggest effort to arise from?
 - Do individual (within subject) differences play a role in appointing a average score to a chair type?
 - Does variability between subjects play a role in determining the 'best' chair type?

## The statistical model 
Statistical models (in R) can be specified by a `model formula`. The left side of the formula is the dependent variable, the right side are the 'predictors'. Here we include a `fixed` and a `random` term to the model (as is common for mixed-effects models)

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(nlme)
```
```{r, echo=TRUE}
ergo_model <- lme(
  data = ergoStool, # the data to be used for the model
  fixed = effort ~ Type, # the dependent and fixed effects variables
  random = ~1 | Subject # observations for effort are assumed to be randomized over Subject
)
```

<p style="font-size:18px">The `lme()` function is part of the [`{nlme}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nlme/index.html) package for mixed effects modelling in R</p>

<p style="font-size:18px">Example reproduced from: [Pinheiro and Bates, 2000, _Mixed-Effects Models in S and S-PLUS_, Springer, New York.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nlme/index.html)</p>

## The statistical results
```{r}
result <- ergo_model %>% summary() 
result$tTable %>% as.data.frame() %>% knitr::kable()
```

## Model diagnostics {.build}

 >- Diagnostics of a fitted model is the most important step in a statistical analysis
 >- In most scientific papers the details are lacking 
 >- Did the authors omit to perform this step? Or did they not report it?
 >- If you do not want to include it in your paper, put it in an appendix!
 
## Residuals

A residual plot shows the 'residual' error ('unexplained variance') after fitting the model. Under the Normality assumption standardized residuals should:
 
 >1. Be normally distributed around 0
 >1. Display no obvious 'patters'
 >1. Should display overall equal 'spread' above and below 0 ('assumption of equal variance')
 
## Residual plot
```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(ergo_model) ## type = 'pearson' (standardized residuals)
```

## The conclusions in a plot
```{r}

set.seed(123)

## Coming from SPSS or Excel or the likes

 - You have to unlearn what you've learned
 - You already know about performing statistical analysis and maybe also coding (SPSS syntax)
 - IBM (SPSS) is proprietary
 - I will take time to transfer
 - Try a hard-stop: so do not mix tools
 - Programming (in R) is hard and takes practice and time
 - I cannot learn you programming, you will have to do it yourself
 - Start with the book: "R for Data Science"
 - **Write code for humans!**
 - Use Github for version control
